To understand and demonstrate DFA minimization and equivalence testing by exploring the systematic process of reducing DFAs to their minimal equivalent forms. Students will learn to identify and remove unreachable states, partition states based on their accepting properties and transition behaviors, and apply the state partitioning algorithm to create minimal DFAs. Through interactive experimentation with parallel DFA minimization, students will gain practical experience in determining when two DFAs are equivalent by comparing their minimized forms, understanding the fundamental relationship between DFA optimization and language recognition efficiency.
